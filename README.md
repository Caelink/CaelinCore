# CaelinCore

[![codebeat badge](https://codebeat.co/badges/fa0b2065-0867-4e67-8773-ec1877173ea3)](https://codebeat.co/projects/github-com-caelink-caelincore-master)

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first. Right now there's nothing useful in the example app, but as I get more direction with this project that might change.

## Requirements

## Installation

CaelinCore is available through my private pod repository. To install
it, add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'CaelinCore'
```

and add the pod to your personal pod repository, or request access from me directly and I'll give access if I feel like it's reasonable.
